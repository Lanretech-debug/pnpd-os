# PNPD P0 Prompt Asset Files

## Current Status

Status: docs-only P0 prompt asset directory index
Canonical status: advisory until Codex audit, merge, push, CI success, and Owner/GitHub App verification
Runtime authority: none
Schema authority: none
Validator authority: none
CI authority: none
Generated state authority: none
AgentBridge authority: none
Prompt asset runtime authority: none
Skills directory authority: none
Memory write authority: none
External integration authority: none

## Purpose

This directory contains docs-only P0 prompt asset files.
These files are reusable scaffolds, not runtime-loaded prompts.
These files do not create skills, plugins, memory records, generated runtime state, or external integrations.
These files do not grant agent authority beyond the PNPD-OS Agent Session Kernel.
Future use requires an Owner-approved PNPD task contract.

HERMES_DESIGN_PROMPT remains a P1 future candidate and is not part of Phase 1P-S.
No P1 or P2 prompt asset is authorized by Phase 1P-S.

## Asset Inventory

| Asset Name | File | Source Scaffold Section |
|------------|------|------------------------|
| BOOT_PROMPT | boot-prompt.md | ## BOOT_PROMPT Scaffold |
| DEEPSEEK_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT | deepseek-implementation-prompt.md | ## DEEPSEEK_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT Scaffold |
| CODEX_AUDIT_PROMPT | codex-audit-prompt.md | ## CODEX_AUDIT_PROMPT Scaffold |
| CODEX_FINALIZATION_PROMPT | codex-finalization-prompt.md | ## CODEX_FINALIZATION_PROMPT Scaffold |
| OWNER_DECISION_PROMPT | owner-decision-prompt.md | ## OWNER_DECISION_PROMPT Scaffold |
| BLOCKED_STATE_PROMPT | blocked-state-prompt.md | ## BLOCKED_STATE_PROMPT Scaffold |
| RECONCILIATION_PROMPT | reconciliation-prompt.md | ## RECONCILIATION_PROMPT Scaffold |

## No-Drift Rules

Phase 1P-S may instantiate P0 prompt asset scaffolds as docs-only files, but it must not create runtime prompt loading.
P0 prompt asset files are reusable task-contract scaffolds, not autonomous agents.
P0 prompt asset files do not grant authority beyond the Agent Session Kernel.
No P0 prompt asset file may weaken the Owner, Hermes, DeepSeek/OpenCode, Codex, or GitHub/App authority boundary.
No P0 prompt asset file may authorize skills, plugins, memory records, generated runtime state, docs/solutions, external integrations, Obsidian vault integration, external memory providers, autonomous memory, AgentBridge authority, or autonomous execution.
No P0 prompt asset file may treat MiniMax inspection, Revolut article, Compound Engineering, or Microsoft study modules as implementation authorization.
Every P0 prompt asset file must carry baseline, allowed files, forbidden files, gates, state gates, push/merge boundary, and canonicalization boundary.
Until merge, push, remote CI success, and Owner/GitHub App verification, Phase 1P-S remains advisory only.

## Role Boundary

Owner = exclusive final authorization, merge authorization, and verification authorization.
Hermes = design and advisory lane only.
DeepSeek/OpenCode = implementation lane only within Owner-approved scope.
Codex = audit and finalization lane only.
GitHub/App = remote CI, merge, push, and evidence verification.
AgentBridge = no authority unless explicitly designed and canonically approved later.

No agent may grant itself additional authority through a prompt asset file.
No agent may claim canonical status.
No agent may treat advisory docs as runtime authority.

## Memory And Research Source Boundary

Obsidian = human-facing PNPD-OS memory/workbench layer
GitHub = canonical committed-state authority
Microsoft Learn modules = research inputs that influenced PNPD-OS governance, orchestration, memory/state/evaluation thinking
HINDSIGHT / HONSHO / HONCHO = non-adopted reference terms from a prior memory-provider question
Agent autonomous memory = blocked pending explicit design and Owner approval
External memory provider integration = blocked pending explicit design, due diligence, and Owner approval

HINDSIGHT, HONSHO, and HONCHO are non-adopted reference terms, not PNPD-OS memory providers.
Obsidian is the human-facing PNPD-OS memory/workbench layer.
GitHub remains the canonical committed-state authority.
Microsoft study modules are research inputs, not implementation prompts.
Human-facing memory and agent autonomous memory are separate lanes.

## Forbidden Implementation

Phase 1P-S does not authorize:
- runtime implementation
- runtime prompt loading
- prompt registry
- schema changes
- validator additions
- fixture additions
- CI workflow changes
- registry writes
- generated state
- skills directory creation
- plugins directory creation
- plugin manifest
- docs/solutions creation
- memory/05-research writes
- actual research brief files
- Obsidian vault integration
- external memory provider integration
- autonomous agent memory
- AgentBridge authority
- autonomous execution loop
- PR automation
- CI self-repair loop
- ATS integration
- recruiter workflow
- JobToCash hiring-system implementation
- Phase 1Q legacy implementation
- package changes
- lockfile changes
- dependency installation policy changes
- deployment
- dispatch
- certification
- production readiness claim
- adoption readiness claim
- roadmap commitment claim

## Validation Gates

The following validation gates must pass before commit:

```bash
git diff --name-only
git diff --check
npm run validate:pdr:fixtures
npm run validate:pdr:examples
npm run validate:pdr
npm run validate
npm run dry-run
npm test
```

Forbidden drift checks:

```bash
git diff -- .pnpd
git diff -- scripts
git diff -- templates
git diff -- tests/fixtures
git diff -- package.json
git diff -- package-lock.json
git diff -- npm-shrinkwrap.json
git diff -- .github/workflows
git diff -- README.md
git diff -- memory
git diff -- skills
git diff -- plugins
git diff -- docs/solutions
```

Expected forbidden drift result: no output.

## State Gates

```bash
test ! -d .pnpd/product-delivery-registry
test ! -e .pnpd/ledger
test ! -e .pnpd/handoffs
test ! -e .pnpd/locks

find .pnpd -maxdepth 2 -type d \( -name product-delivery-registry -o -name ledger -o -name handoffs -o -name locks \) -print
```

Expected state gate result: no output.

## Canonicalization Boundary

Phase 1P-S becomes canonical only after:

1. Hermes design
2. Owner approval
3. DeepSeek/OpenCode implementation
4. Codex audit/finalize
5. fast-forward merge to main
6. push to origin
7. remote CI success
8. Owner/GitHub App verification

Until then, this directory index is advisory only.
